                        <p style="margin-bottom: 5px;">BGC's philosophy on promotional gear aims to reflect our Core Values in our everyday practice. Our promo gear offerings include high quality, functional, and practical items from tried-and-true sources.&nbsp;<br><br>When requesting items, please select request form instead of requesting items in person, for example when visiting larger offices. If your items are in stock, the Admin Team will help coordinate getting the item(s) to you.<br><br>Use good judgement and common sense in your requests. If you're requesting promotional gear for personal use, please keep the following in mind:<br></p>
                        <ul class="indent" style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
                            <li>As a general guideline, please limit your promo gear requests to one large item (jacket or luggage) per 12-month period. More items may result in a personal tax deduction to you on your paystub. And, because we can only order limited amounts of items based on supplier inventories, more items for you also means fewer items will be available for other BGCers.<br></li>
                            <li>New full-time regular staff will receive promo gear such as a backpack, waterbottle, etc. as part of their onboarding and are welcome to request large items (jacket/luggage) after they join.<br></li>
                            <li>Please refrain from requesting items that you will not use regularly during BGC projects or for business-related travel. For example, if you do not participate in field work, please refrain from requesting field-specific backpacks to ensure that there is enough stock for field staff.<br></li>
                            <li>We really want to match you with gear that you'll love. If you request something and it's not quite the right size or you just want to make sure you're getting the right piece, please talk to a member of the Promo Gear Team so we can help you out.<br></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"><br>If you have any quality concerns with the promotional gear you have (e.g., the BGC logo is looking a bit shabby, the zipper is busted, or you've just worn it out), then please don't throw it away. Most of our promo gear items have robust warranty programs, so please contact the Promo Gear Team for a fix or replacement. Also please make sure you read the care instructions for Gore-tex items.<br><br>If you have a valued client and you'd like to make them feel like one of the team, then feel free to request an item for them using the 'Client or Event Request' form. Make sure you know whether the client's company has any strict rules regarding gifts and perceived/actual conflicts of interest.&nbsp;<br><br>If you have an upcoming conference or event, feel free to assemble packages from the Promo Gear Site using the 'Client or Event Request' form.&nbsp;If we don't have what you're looking for, then the Promo Gear Team may be able to help you out.<br></p>
